Hey! I'm Remy â€” I used to game for hours without ever thinking about what was behind the screen. But somewhere between building my first PC, self-hosting a server, and pulling my first API request, the spark hit.

Now, I'm deep in the world of **data engineering**, **cloud architecture**, and **devops**, turning raw data into clean dashboards, spinning up infra with code, and documenting every bit of it as I go. Whether itâ€™s using **Snowflake**, **AWS Glue**, **BigQuery**, or **dbt**, Iâ€™m all about **clarity, automation, and meaningful insights**.

I don't just want to learn â€” I want to **apply, iterate, and share**. My GitHub is where my journey unfolds, from real-world projects to sharp scripts, dashboards, and everything in between.
